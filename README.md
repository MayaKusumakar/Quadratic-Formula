# Quadratic-Formula
## Problem
A quadratic equation is an equation in the form 

The roots of a quadratic equation are values of x that cause the equation to evaluate to 0 and can be solved for using the quadratic equation: 

Depending on the values of a, b, and c there may be 0, 1, or 2 real solutions.

Write a program called quad.c that asks the user for a, b, and c and then displays the real roots of x if there are any.

## Requirements
### Problem Specific
Your program must have at least one other function besides main
General
There must be a comment at the top of your program describing what it does
Each function in your program must have a comment
Describing what the function does
Describing the meaning of each parameter
Describing what the function returns
Print all doubles to 2 decimal points unless stated otherwise
Restrictions
No global variables may be used
Assumptions
Input will always be valid
Real values, values with decimal points, may be entered for a, b, and c
The user will never enter a value of 0 for the "a" variable
Tips
When there are 2 solutions the + solution is printed first
