# Quadratic-Formula
## Problem
A quadratic equation is an equation in the form: ax^2 + bx + c 

The roots of a quadratic equation are values of x that cause the equation to evaluate to 0 and can be solved for using the quadratic equation.

Depending on the values of a, b, and c there may be 0, 1, or 2 real solutions.

The program called quad.c asks the user for a, b, and c and then displays the real roots of x if there are any.

## Requirements
  - Your program must have at least one other function besides main
  - Print all doubles to 2 decimal points unless stated otherwise

## Restrictions
No global variables may be used
## Assumptions
  - Input will always be valid
  - Real values, values with decimal points, may be entered for a, b, and c
  - The user will never enter a value of 0 for the "a" variable
  - When there are 2 solutions the + solution is printed first

# Examples

## Example 1
Given a quadratic equation of the form a*x^2 + b * x + c
